# cpp_tof_grouping
A simple tool to test TOF counters grouping to trigger bits
 This simple tool is to calculate two parameters:
  1) acceptance for CPP 2 pion events below 500MeV
 with respect to the acceptance of "one trigger bit
 per one TOF counter" trigger organization,
  2) The ratio (in arbitrary units) of the signal acceptance
 and background trigger rate (data from the latest CPP test run)

 One color in the scheme designates one trigger group (max of 16 groups allowed).
 To calculate parameters, press Calculate button (takes few seconds).
 To modify trigger grouping: click on the small color square on the left,
 if active it will be bold outlined; than click on the TOF counters - they will take
 corresponding color. The scheme below is showng number of counters in groups.
